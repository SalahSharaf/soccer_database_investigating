# soccer_database_investigating
it was udacity capstone project of mastering pandas and python

## data
<br/>
in this project i have downlaoded the soccer data base provided by EA Sporting Games from kaggle 
the data is about every team player and there attributes in europe seasons 2008-2016

## the final result:
i answered three questions which are :
 how is the best player in europe seasons 2008-2016
 what is the best team in europe seasons 2008-2016
if we are to select the best soccer line up it will consist of whom and what is the best line up that fits
but unluckly there was no enough data about the match lineup of each team
